XwtPlus.TextEditor
==================

A port of Mono.TextEditor to Xwt.

This requires several changes to Xwt, such as adding text input events. Because of this, this currently only supports the WPF backend (and, even then, it requires a custom version).

This does not support all Mono.TextEditor features.
It is mostly for demonstration purposes.
